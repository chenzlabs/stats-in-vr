## yet another necro component pulled into service

This one is revived from back in the olden days! A-Frame 0.4.0 is close to as old as I've seen (pretty sure I have pulled a library somewhere that had a demo on 0.3.0?). Very cool that this 5 year old code can still be called into service.

I've wanted this for a while, but I googled, found this, and then found what looked like a [promising pull request](https://github.com/chenzlabs/stats-in-vr/pull/1
).

Which, with just one tiny bug fix, was found to work even on A-Frame 1.2.0!

~~though it seems the bars may not be working properly and that they perhaps used to. perhaps some more tinkering is in order?~~ Got the bars working again. :D Also spent a few hours going over it, refactoring stuff in the process. ~~I now realize it adds about 40-50 draw calls or so, because it works by adding a ton of images with canvas with text as textures for every value.~~ NM, fixed that too. Now all text stats are rendered as one buttery smooth image with canvas texture.

I spent time working on the code, but not yet the repo. It's got all the usual boilerplate, now fallen way out of date. I just use the 'stats-in-vr.js' file and ignore the rest for now, may clean up rest of repo later. 

You can access it through jsdelivr's cdn here: https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/kylebakerio/stats-in-vr@1.1.0/stats-in-vr.js

**AGAIN, Note that the build/dist files are NOT up to date with this one file listed above--they wouldn't build because of the ES6 syntax used in my bug fix, and the build tools are just that old.**

stats-in-vr component for [A-Frame](https://aframe.io).

## Examples

### default behavior:
when you enter VR, full stats get attached to your face, about half a meter down and forward from you. When you are not in VR, you see the normal 2d stats.
```html
<a-scene stats-in-vr></a-scene>
```

### just want fps and tirangles, including their graphs
```html
<a-scene stats-in-vr="showlabels:fps,triangles; showgraphs:fps,triangles"></a-scene>
```

### no graphs, just numbers please
```html
<a-scene stats-in-vr="showallgraphs:false"></a-scene>
```

### only fps graph, but all numbers
```html
<a-scene stats-in-vr="showgraphs:fps;showalllabels:true"></a-scene>
```

### attach translucent stats to your left hand when you enter vr:
```html
    <script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/donmccurdy/aframe-extras@v6.1.1/dist/aframe-extras.min.js"></script>
    <script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/kylebakerio/stats-in-vr@1.2.2/stats-in-vr.js"></script>

    <a-scene stats-in-vr="anchorel:#left-hand; position:0 -.5 0;showallgraphs:true;fillstyle:rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.5);">
      <a-entity id="rig" movement-controls="fly:true;" position="0 0 0">
        <a-entity camera position="0 1.6 0" look-controls>
        </a-entity>
        <a-entity id="left-hand" hand-controls="hand: left"></a-entity>
        <a-entity hand-controls="hand: right"></a-entity>
      </a-entity>
    </a-scene>
```

### make it a permanent fixture in your scene, vr or not:
stick a VR panel somewhere you want in the scene, and make it stay there, whether you're in VR or not.
```html
<a-scene stats-in-vr="anchorel:#the-box;position:0 .4 0;showallgraphs:true; alwaysshow3dstats:true; show2dstats:false;" >
     <a-circle id="floor" rotation="-90 0 0" radius="400" color="#7BC8A4"></a-circle>
     <a-box id="the-box" position="-1 0.5 -6" rotation="0 45 0" color="red"></a-box>
</a-scene>
```
